SCENEXR PRIVACY POLICY

Last Updated: December 22, 2025

Welcome to SceneXR! We at ANY Reality LLC ("Company," "we," "us," or "our") respect your privacy and have composed this Privacy Policy to help you understand how we process your Personal Data (defined below) and your choices about the data we process.

In this Privacy Policy, we refer to the SceneXR game as the “Game” and the SceneXR website scenexr.com as the “Site”. We also refer to the Game and the Site collectively as the “Services”.

This Privacy Policy explains what Personal Data (defined below) we collect in connection with the Services, how we use and share that data, and your choices concerning our data practices. This policy applies only to information we collect via the Services and in email, text, and other electronic communications sent through or in connection with the Services.

This policy DOES NOT apply to information that you provide to or is collected by any third party (except as described under "Third-Party Information Collection"), or which is collected outside of the Services.

This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and forms part of our Terms of Service scenexr.com/terms-of-services.

Before using the Services or submitting any Personal Data to Company, please review this Privacy Policy carefully and contact us at the email address below if you have any questions.

By using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, do not download, register with, or use the Services.

1. DATA CONTROLLER / BUSINESS

ANY Reality LLC will be the entity responsible for your data (acting as a "controller" or "business" depending on applicable privacy laws). To ask questions or comment about this privacy policy and our privacy practices, you can contact us at:

Email: hello@scenexr.com

2. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY

Our Services are not directed to or intended for children who are under the age of 13 without appropriate parental consent and supervision as described herein. ANY Reality LLC does not knowingly collect Personal Data directly from children under the age of 13 in a manner inconsistent with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) or similar applicable laws.

If we learn we have collected or received Personal Data from a child under 13 (or a higher age if stipulated by local law, e.g., under 16 in some European jurisdictions without verified parental consent where required) without verification of parental consent where necessary, we will take steps to delete that information. If you have reason to believe that a child under the applicable age has provided Personal Data to ANY Reality LLC through the Services in a non-compliant manner, please contact us at hello@scenexr.com, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.

The gameplay experience for users who identify themselves as being under the age of 13, or who are identified by Meta (our primary platform provider) as being under 13, may be automatically restricted to limit the processing of personal information in accordance with platform policies and applicable law. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child and you would like your child to be permitted to play the Game, Meta allows you to create an age-restricted account for your child called a Parent-Managed Meta account. You can find more information about Meta Parent-Managed accounts here. Parents or guardians are responsible for monitoring their child’s use of the Services, including their interactions and any User Content they create or share.

3. PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT

We collect information that alone or in combination with other information in our possession could be used to identify you (“Personal Data”) as follows:

Personal Data You Provide:

    Account Information (via Platform): When you access the Game, typically through a platform like Meta Quest, we receive account information from that platform, such as your platform User ID (e.g., Oculus User ID), platform username (e.g., Oculus username), and platform profile picture.

    Communications with Us: When you contact us directly (e.g., for support, to provide feedback, or regarding this Privacy Policy), we will collect the Personal Data you choose to include in your communications (e.g., your email address, name, and the content of your message).

    In-Game Communications & User Content: When you use the Game, you may create or share content and communicate with other players. This includes:

        User-Generated Content: Information related to your custom builds, map modifications, and other creations within the Game (e.g., content itself, creator ID, creation date).

        Voice Chat: If you use in-game voice chat, your voice communications may be processed.

        Text Chat (if applicable): If the Game includes text chat, we will process the content of those messages.

    Purchases: If you make in-app purchases, the platform (e.g., Meta) processes the payment, but we may receive information about your purchase history (e.g., items purchased, date, platform transaction ID) to fulfill your order and for our records. We do not directly collect or store your payment card details.

Automatically Collected Information (Usage Data):

When you visit, use, and interact with the Services, we and our third-party service providers may receive certain information about your visit, use, or interactions.

    In the Game: We may collect:

        Device Information: Device ID, VR headset type, operating system, IP address (which may be used to derive an approximate geographic location).

        Gameplay Information: Usage details such as time spent in the Game, features used, levels played, game progress, achievements, interactions with game elements, User Content created or interacted with, and other gameplay statistics.

        Technical Information: Crash reports, error logs, performance data, and other technical information to help us diagnose and fix issues.

        Multiplayer Information (if applicable): Session data, interactions with other players (e.g., joining a session, in-game actions relative to others).

    Cookies and Similar Technologies:

        Site Cookies (if applicable): A “cookie” is a piece of information sent to your browser by a website you visit. Our Site may use session cookies (which expire when you close your browser or after a set time) and persistent cookies (which remain on your device for a longer period). These may include strictly necessary cookies for site functionality, and potentially analytics or preference cookies if you implement them. For more details on cookies please visit All About Cookies.

		Game Technologies: The Game itself may use local storage on your device to save preferences, game state, or identifiers, but these are generally not "cookies" in the web sense. We do not use tracking cookies for advertising purposes within the Game environment itself.

    Location Data: We may derive an approximate geographic location from your IP address to understand general user distribution, for regional content (if any), or for security purposes. We do not collect precise geolocation data through GPS or similar technologies without your explicit consent.

    Do Not Track Signals: Our Services (including the Site, if any) currently do not respond to “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) signals and operate as described in this Privacy Policy whether or not a DNT signal is received. If we do so in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy.

Third-Party Information Collection Through the Services:

Some features of the Services are supported by third-party services. When you use our Services, these third parties may use automatic information collection technologies to collect information about you or your device. The Personal Data that we receive from these Third-Party Services is covered by this Privacy Policy, while their independent processing of your information is covered by their respective privacy policies.

    Vendors and Service Providers: With third-party vendors and service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as platform providers (Meta) and multiplayer service providers. These parties are authorized to use your Personal Data only as necessary to provide these services to us and are under contractual obligations to protect it.

    Other Players: Certain Personal Data, such as your platform username, profile picture, and your User Content (custom builds, etc.), will be visible to other players within the Game as part of the multiplayer and social experience. Your voice in voice chat will be audible to other players in your session.

    Business Transfers: If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of all or a portion of our assets, or transition of service to another provider (a “Transaction”), your Personal Data may be shared during the diligence process and transferred to a successor or affiliate as part of that Transaction.

We do not "sell" your Personal Data in the traditional sense (i.e., for monetary payment). However, California law (CCPA/CPRA) has a broader definition of "sell" and "share" (for cross-context behavioral advertising).

7. DATA RETENTION, STORAGE, AND INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS

Storage Location: Information we collect is primarily processed and stored in the United States. If you are accessing the Services from outside the United States, please be aware that your Personal Data will be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States, where data protection laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction.

Retention Period: We retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including to provide the Services, comply with our legal obligations (e.g., for tax and accounting purposes), resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and for our legitimate business interests (e.g., to improve and develop the Services and prevent fraud).

Aggregated or de-identified data may be retained indefinitely.

Cross-border Data Transfers: By using the Services, you consent to the transfer of your Personal Data to the United States. Where cross-border transfers are necessary (e.g., if we use service providers in other countries), we take steps to ensure that your Personal Data receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it, which may include implementing Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or relying on other lawful transfer mechanisms.

8. DATA SECURITY

We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures designed to protect your Personal Data from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. We primarily rely on the security measures of our platform provider (Meta) and our chosen third-party service providers who employ industry-standard security practices.

However, the transmission of information via the internet and VR platforms is not completely secure. Although we strive to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Any transmission of Personal Data is at your own risk. We are not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Services or on third-party platforms.

9. YOUR RIGHTS AND CHOICES

You have certain rights and choices regarding your Personal Data.
